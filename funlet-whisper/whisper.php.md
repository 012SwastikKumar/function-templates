*based on a snapshot of Whisper TwiML source code (whisper.php)
sent to me by Twilio support by email on 2019-07-08*

This is PHP code.

It uses the (deprecated) class
[Twilio\Twiml](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/reference/twilio-php/5.34.1/class-Twilio.Twiml.html)
of the [twilio-php](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php) helper library
to generate TwiML.

```
use Twilio\Twiml;
```

Start a new TwiML document.

```
// initiate response library
$response = new Twiml();
```

### Stage 2

```
// if we have a Digits= parameter, then this is the 2nd loop of this script
if (isset($_REQUEST['Digits'])) {

	// if a digit was pressed, then let us drop through
	if (!strlen($_REQUEST['Digits'])) {
```

This part seems unreachable: `<Gather/>` falls through to the rest of
the document without triggering the `action` URL when no digits have
been pressed:

> However, if the caller did not enter any digits or speech,
> call flow would continue in the original TwiML document.
> â€” https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/gather#action

```
		// no digit was pressed, so just hangup
		$response->hangup();

	}

	// otherwise, we'll just return an empty document, which will bridge the calls
```

### Stage 1

```
} else {

	// no digits submitted, so this is the first run of the whisper file

	// grab the caller's phone number
	$from = strlen($_REQUEST['From']) ? $_REQUEST['From'] : $_REQUEST['Caller'];

	// add a Gather to get the digits when pressed
	$gather = $response->gather(array(
		'numDigits' => 1,
	));

	// figure out the message
	// first, check to see if we have an http URL (simple check)
	if (strtolower(substr(trim($_GET['Message']), 0, 4)) == 'http') {
		$gather->play($_GET['Message']);
	}

	// check if we have any message, if so, read it back
	elseif (strlen(trim($_GET['Message']))) {
		$gather->say(stripslashes($_GET['Message']));
	}

	// no message, just use a default
	else {
		$gather->say('You are receiving a call from ' . preg_replace('/([^\s])/', '$1. ', $from) . '.  Press any key to accept.');
	}

	// if we're screening to check for a person answering, hangup the call if gather falls through
	if (isset($_REQUEST['HumanCheck'])) {
		$response->hangup();
	}
}
```

Send the XML content-type header and the TwiML body.

```
// send response
if (!headers_sent()) {
	header('Content-type: text/xml');
}
echo $response;
```
